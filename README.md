Project: Automated greenhouse (made by Assylbek Omarov):

This project was made with additional help of internet and sample projects on the internet.

Criteria for this project:
// Design and pratical implementation of the small automated greenhouse for home:
1) air temperature measurement.
2) air humidity measurement.
3) soil humidity measurement.
4) light control.
5) heating control.



As a foundation I used my new acquired knowledge and then did some research on others projects and took things like codes for components so they code work all together
